= About the Attachments directory

An attachment is a resource, such as the ZIP archive of a sample project, that a image:architecture-repository:common:i-arbeid.png visitor can download via a link. Attachment files are saved in the attachments directory. A link to an attachment is created using the AsciiDoc link macro.
